# Memory image example - comments are allowed in lines that start with # as first character!
# The memory image file is composed from segments of 2 types, defined by an "@" location/type line:
#  1. "I@<address>" : The following lines are instructions at given memory offset.
#     Each subsequent line (up to the next empty line or comment) is an instruction of format: <command> <dst>,<src1>,<src2>
#     Commands is one of: NOP, ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, BR, BREQ, BRNEQ
#     operands are $<num> for any general purpose register, or just a number (in decimal or hex.) for immediate (for src2 only)
#  2. "D@<address>" : The following lines are data values at given memory offset.
#     Each subsequent line (up to the next empty line or comment) is data value of a 32 bit (in decimal or hex.) data word, e.g., 0x12A556FF
# The instructions are:
# 	NOP
#	ADD $dst, $src1, $src2 		(dst <- src1 + src2)
#	SUB $dst, $src1, $src2 		(dst <- src1 - src2)
#	LOAD $dst, $src1, $src2 	(dst <- Mem[src1 + src2]  src2 may be an immediate)
#	STORE $dst, $src1, $src2 	(Mem[dst + src2] <- src1  src2 may be an immediate)
#	BR $dst 					(Unconditional relative branch to PC+dst register value)
#	BREQ $dst, $src1, $src2		(Branch to PC+dst if src1 == src2)
#	BRNEQ $dst, $src1, $src2	(Branch to PC+dst if src1 != src2)

# 
# 	for(i=3;i>0;--i){
#	}
# }
# Program start at address 0, after reset.
